    "## Week 1: Literature Review and Scope Definition \n",
    "\n",
    "After my kickstarter meeting with Professor Rachlin, I began reading and documenting relevant papers in the field of: Neural Network Hyperparameter Tuning, Multi-Objective Optimization and Evolutionary Deep Learning. These works provided me the necessary background to identify the research area: Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization of Neural Network Architecture using Evolutionary Algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than relying on manual experimentation, which currently functions as a “black art”, with no standardized protocol, using rational agents to iteratively evolve and optimize neural networks may, at best, provide such protocol or, at worst, provide information on relationships between configuration specifications and performance metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "These agents not only adjust high-level hyperparameters, such as learning rates or activation functions, but also actively modify the structure of the network itself, including the number of layers, types of layers, and the interconnections between them. By formulating the problem as a multi-objective optimization task, the candidate solutions balance competing goals such as accuracy, complexity, and training efficiency. ML practicioners can use this research to assess which tradeoffs are important for their research and analysis objectives, and specify hyperparameters accordingly.\n",

    "- pg 1: But in many applications, we are not only interested in optimizing ML pipelines solely for predictive accuracy; additional metrics or constraints must be considered when determining an optimal configuration, resulting in a multi-objective optimization problem often neglected in practice, due to a lack of knowledge and readily available software implementations\n",
